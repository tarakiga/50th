# WhatsApp Template Fallback Plan 📱

If your WhatsApp Business template is not approved in time, this guide provides multiple backup options to ensure confirmed guests receive their complete event details.

## 🚨 **The Challenge**

WhatsApp Business API templates can take 24-48 hours to approve, and sometimes longer. Your Golden Jubilee celebration can't wait! This fallback system ensures that confirmed guests receive their venue details regardless of template approval status.

## 🎯 **4 Proven Fallback Methods**

---

## **Method 1: Direct WhatsApp (No Template) ⭐ RECOMMENDED**

**How it works:** Send event details as regular WhatsApp text messages without using templates.

### **Setup:**
```bash
# Use your existing WhatsApp Business API credentials
# No additional setup required!
```

### **Usage:**
```bash
cd scripts
node fallback-event-details-sender.js --method=whatsapp
```

### **Pros:**
- ✅ **Same delivery channel** - Guests expect WhatsApp
- ✅ **High open rate** - Nearly 100% message open rate
- ✅ **Uses existing credentials** - No new setup needed
- ✅ **Automated delivery** - Send to all confirmed guests at once
- ✅ **Includes BLACK TIE notice** for cocktail guests

### **Cons:**
- ⚠️ **Rate limits may apply** - 3-second delays between messages
- ⚠️ **No template formatting** - Plain text messages only

### **Message Example:**
```
