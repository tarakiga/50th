**Status:** Revised

### **1. Introduction & Vision**

#### 1.1. Problem Statement  
Managing a private event with a limited and exclusive guest list remains a cumbersome and insecure process. Traditional methods like group chats compromise privacy, while manual RSVP tracking is inefficient. Hosts need a secure, elegant, and automated solution that enhances guest experience while maintaining strict access control.

#### 1.2. Product Vision  
To deliver a premium, web-based invitation platform that combines **Fortune 500-grade design and reliability** with seamless automation. The app will act as a digital concierge—verifying guest identity, managing RSVPs securely, and delivering sensitive event details (like the full address) **exclusively via WhatsApp Business API** to confirmed attendees, ensuring privacy and a white-glove experience.

### **2. Goals & Objectives**

#### 2.1. Business Goals  
* Create a “wow” factor that reflects luxury, exclusivity, and operational excellence.  
* Position the app as a best-in-class digital invitation experience comparable to premium consumer brands (e.g., Apple, Net-a-Porter, Soho House).  
* Demonstrate enterprise-grade integration capabilities via WhatsApp Business API.

#### 2.2. Product Goals  
* **Security:** Only pre-approved guests can RSVP; location details are never exposed on the web.  
* **Automation:** Real-time RSVP tracking + automatic, secure delivery of venue address via WhatsApp.  
* **Premium UX:** A polished, responsive, and emotionally resonant interface that feels bespoke and high-end.

### **3. Target Audience & User Personas**  
*(Unchanged from v1.0 — personas remain valid.)*

---

### **4. Updated User Stories & Features**

#### 4.1. Guest Invitation Flow *(Enhanced)*  
* **As a guest,** I want to receive a personal, unique link via WhatsApp, so I feel specially invited.  
* **As a guest,** I want to see my name and event details on a beautifully designed page, reinforcing exclusivity.  
* **As a guest who confirms attendance,** I want to receive the **exact venue address and directions instantly via WhatsApp**, so I don’t need to remember or screenshot it—and so it’s never publicly visible.

#### 4.2. Host Management Flow *(Enhanced)*  
* **As a host,** I want confirmed guests to automatically receive the private venue address via WhatsApp, so I don’t have to share it manually or risk leaks.  
* **As a host,** I want full confidence that only “Attending” guests receive location details—and that this happens reliably and instantly.

### **5. Updated Functional Requirements**

#### 5.1. Guest List Database  
* Unchanged: Google Sheet with columns `Name`, `PhoneNumber`, `Token`, `RSVPStatus`.  
* **New Requirement:** `PhoneNumber` must be in E.164 format (e.g., +14155552671) to be compatible with WhatsApp Business API.

#### 5.2–5.3. Unique Links & Invitation Page Logic  
* Unchanged from v1.0.

#### 5.4. RSVP Logic *(Enhanced)*  
* When a guest clicks **“Attending”**:  
  1. Backend updates `RSVPStatus = "Attending"` in Google Sheet.  
  2. Backend triggers a **WhatsApp Business API message** to the guest’s registered phone number.  
  3. The message includes:  
     - A warm confirmation note (e.g., “You’re confirmed for Alex’s Golden Hour Cocktail!”)  
     - The **full venue address**  
     - Optional: Google Maps link or embedded location (if supported by WhatsApp template)  
  4. Frontend displays a success screen: *“You’re all set! Check WhatsApp for your private location details.”*  
* If guest clicks **“Declined”**:  
  - Standard confirmation shown; **no WhatsApp message sent**.

#### 5.5. Admin Dashboard  
* Unchanged, but now includes a **“WhatsApp Delivery Status”** column (e.g., “Sent”, “Failed”, “Pending”) for each attending guest.

#### 5.6. WhatsApp Business API Integration  
* The system must use **Meta’s WhatsApp Business API** (via official partner or Cloud API).  
* All messages must comply with WhatsApp’s **template messaging policies**.  
* A pre-approved message template must include:  
  ```text
  Hi {{1}}, you're confirmed for {{2}}!  
  Venue: {{3}}  
  See you there!  
  ```  
* Error handling: If WhatsApp delivery fails (invalid number, opt-out, etc.), log error and notify host via dashboard.

### **6. Enhanced Non-Functional Requirements**

#### 6.1. UI/UX – Fortune 500 Premium Standard  
* **Design System:**  
  - **Color Palette:** Charcoal (`#1a1a1a`) + Gold (`#d4af37`) + neutral off-whites (`#f8f8f8`, `#eaeaea`).  
  - **Typography:** Inter (variable font) with refined hierarchy, generous whitespace, and micro-interactions.  
  - **Imagery:** Optional subtle background textures or gradients (e.g., gold foil, marble) — never distracting.  
* **Interactions:**  
  - All transitions use **Framer Motion** or equivalent for buttery-smooth 60fps animations.  
  - RSVP buttons have tactile feedback (scale + shadow on press).  
  - Loading states are elegant (e.g., shimmer skeletons, not spinners).  
* **Responsiveness:**  
  - Fully adaptive across mobile (primary), tablet, and desktop.  
  - Mobile-first design with thumb-friendly tap targets (>48px).  
* **Accessibility:**  
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (contrast, ARIA labels, keyboard nav).

#### 6.2. Security  
* **No client-side exposure** of venue address.  
* WhatsApp messages are the **only channel** for location delivery.  
* Admin token and WhatsApp credentials stored as **encrypted environment variables**.  
* Rate limiting on `/invite` and `/rsvp` endpoints to prevent scraping.

#### 6.3. Performance  
* Core invitation page loads in **< 1.5s** on 3G (via code-splitting, image optimization, CDN).  
* WhatsApp message delivery within **5 seconds** of RSVP confirmation.  
* Dashboard refreshes in real-time (via polling or WebSockets).

---

### **7. Updated Assumptions & Dependencies**

* **WhatsApp Business API Access:** Host (or developer) must have access to a verified WhatsApp Business account and pre-approved message templates.  
* **Google Sheets:** Still used as lightweight backend, but row updates must be atomic to avoid race conditions.  
* **Phone Numbers:** Host must provide **opt-in confirmed numbers** in E.164 format.  
* **Hosting:** Serverless functions (Vercel/Netlify) must support secure outbound HTTPS calls to WhatsApp Cloud API.

---

### **8. Future Scope (Still Out of Scope for v1.1)**  
*(Unchanged from v1.0, except note: WhatsApp integration may enable future features like reminders or calendar links.)*

---

### **9. Success Metrics**  
* **WhatsApp Delivery Rate:** >95% of “Attending” guests receive location via WhatsApp within 10 seconds.  
* **Guest Trust:** 0 complaints about location privacy or confusion.  
* **Host Satisfaction:** Host rates UX as “exceptional” (≥4.8/5 in post-event survey).  
* **Security:** Zero unauthorized access incidents.  
* **Performance:** 95th percentile page load < 2s on mobile.
